1.
What will be the output of the following code, if i = 10 and a[10] = 20:
a[i] = i++;
ambiguos, cant say

2.
What will be the value returned by sizeof('a')
Ans.
4

3.
What will be the output value of c?
int a = 1000, b = 1000;
long int c = a*b;
Ans = 1000000

4.
What will be the output of the following program?
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	char val = 250;
	int ans;
	ans = val + !val + ~val + ++val;
	printf("%d",ans);
}
Ans = -6

5.
What will be the value assigned to the variable x if b is 7?
X = b>8?b<<3:b>4?b>>1:b;
X = b>8?b<<3:3
Ans = 3

6.
a = 0;
b = (a=0)?2:3;
What will be the value of b and why
first expression is a = 0
if first expression is false, expression 3 is returned
b = 3;

7.
a = 0;
b = (a=-1)?2:3;
What will be the value of b
b = 2;
any non zeror value is true, if first expression is true, expression 2 is returned

8.
a = 0;
b = (a=1)?2:3;
b = 2;

9.
What will happen to the following code
main()
{
	int age;
	float ht;
	printf("Enter her age, ht");
	scanf("%d %d",&age,&ht);
	if((age<=20)&&(ht>=5))
	printf("she loves you");
	else
	printf("she loves you");
}
there will be a warning, second conversion character in scanf should be %f
but OP will be generated

10.
main()
{
	int x = 128;
	printf("\n%d",1+x++);
}
129
post increment - first it will participate in addition, then it will be incremented

11.
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int x,y,z;
	x = -5%3;
	y = 5%-3;
	z = -5%-3;
	printf("%d %d %d",x,y,z);
}
-2 2 -2
For % operator the sign of the answer is same as the sign of the numerator

12.
Find the output of the following C program:
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
	int x = 2,y = 6, z = 6;
	x = y == z;
	printf("%d",x);
}
Ans = 1

13.
What is the value of the expression (3^6)+(a^a)? If a is declared as int and has garbage

14.
What will be the output?
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
	int a = 3, b = 2;
	a=a==b==0;
	printf("%d, %d",a,b);
}
Ans a = 1,2
