Library functions
- every C compiler comes with library functions
- certain library functions help for data transfer between computer and input output devices
- getchar, putchar - one character
- gets, puts - string input output
- printf, scanf - single character, string, numeric values
- library function is used by writing name of the function followed by pair of paranthesis - with list of input arguments
- library function may or may not return a value
- if it returns a value - it must be captured in a variable

header file
- header file contains information about library functions
- header file must by included at the beginning of the C program
- header file is included using #include directive
- header file for C input and output functions is - stdio.h
- #include<stdio.h> statement causes the contents of the header file stdio.h to be included in the C program

getchar()
- it is a library function that accepts one character into a character variable from the standard input device which is usually a keyboard
eg:
char ch;
ch = getchar();

putchar()
- it is a library function that displays a single character on the standard output device - which is usually console
eg:
char ch;
ch = getchar();
putchar(ch);

scanf()
- library function to accept data items from standard input device - keyboard
- 2 parts:
character group - in double quotes - % followed by conversion character
data items - address of data items in memory
- in character group, we can specify maximum width of the field
eg: %3d, %4.5f
- conversion character - c, d, x, o, f, s
- conversion character indicates the type of the data item

printf()
- library function that displays data from memory to standard output device
- it consists of control string and list of arguments/data items
printf(control string, ....);
- control string - string that contains formatting information
- data items - constant, variable, array, complex expression, function reference
- control string contain format specifier - place holder - % followed by control character
- control character - indicates type of the data item
- minimum field widtf specifier
- precision specifier
- flags
between % and control character
+ to expilictly show the sign of integer data item
- to display the data item left justified
0 - to fill the empty left spaces with 0

gets()
- accepts single argument
- argument is data item that represents string
- gets(name);

puts()
- accepts single argument
- argument is data item that represents string
- puts(name);
