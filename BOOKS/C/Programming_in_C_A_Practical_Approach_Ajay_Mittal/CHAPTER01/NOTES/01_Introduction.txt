What are the features of C programming language:
- High level programming language
- case sensitive
- free flow
- procedural
- block structured
- standardised

- C was developed by Dennis Ritchie Brian Kernighan at AT and T Bell's Laboratory
- Predecessors of C were B and BCPL
- C was developed as system programming language for development of Unix OS
- BCPL - was developed by Martin Richards in 1967
- B was developed by Ken Thompson

- Each data element was one word size

What are the different C standards
- K and R standard - 1978
- ANSI - 1989
- ISO - 1990

- First learn the letters - C Character set
- combine letters to form words - identifiers
- combine words to form sentences - statements - smallest logical unit of program
- combine sentences to form paragraphs - functions
