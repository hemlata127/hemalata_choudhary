Program1_Check_specified_bit_is_ON_or_OFF
Problem Statement: Write a C program that accepts a number from the user and bit position in that number and checks if that bit is ON or OFF
Run1:
Enter a number: 299599 (1001001001001001111)
Enter bit position: 6
Bit at position 6 in 299599 is OFF
Run2:
Enter a number: 299599 (1001001001001001111)
Enter bit position: 7
64
Bit at position 7 in 299599 is ON

Program2_Check_two_bits_are_ON_or_OFF
Problem Statement: Accept a number from the user and accept two positions. Check if the bits at the specified position are ON or OFF
Enter number: 4559439
Enter position1: 7
Enter position2: 15
Bit at position 7 in 4559439 is ON
Bit at position 15 in 4559439 is OFF

==================================================================================
Program3_Check_first_and_last_bits_are_ON_or_OFF
Problem Statement: Accept a number from the user and check if its first and last bits are ON or OFF
Enter number: 2152043086 (10000000010001011001001001001110)
Bit at first position in 2152043086 is OFF
Bit at last position in 2152043086 is ON

Program4_Turn_OFF_the_specified_bit
Problem Statement: Accept a number from the user and bit position in that number. Turn OFF that bit and display the resulting number
Enter number: 16151721 (111101100111010010101001)
Enter bit position (between 1 and 32): 11
Number after turning off bit 11 = 16150697 (111101100111000010101001)

==================================================================================
Program5_Turn_ON_the_specified_bit
Problem Statement: Accept a number from the user. Accept a bit position and turn ON that bit. Display the number after turning ON the specified bit

Enter bit position (between 1 and 32): 5
Number after turning ON bit 5 = 16151761 (111101100111010011010001)

==================================================================================
Program6_Toggle_specified_bit
Problem Statement: Accept a number from the user and a bit position. Toggle the bit at the specified position and display the resulting number
Enter a number: 16151745 (111101100111010011000001)
Enter bit position to toggle (between 1 ans 32): 3
Number after toggling bit 3 = 16151749 (111101100111010011000101)

==================================================================================
Program7_Toggle_first_last_nibble
Problem Statement: Accept a number from the user and toggle its first and last nibble. Display the resulting number
Enter number: 16151749                                     (00000000111101100111010011000101)
16151749 after toggling first and last nibble = 4042683594 (11110000111101100111010011001010)

==================================================================================
Program8_Count_ON_bits
Problem Statement: Accept a number from the user and count the ON bits in that number
Enter number: 4042683594 (11110000111101100111010011001010)
Number of ON bits in 4042683594 = 18

==================================================================================
Program9_Count_OFF_bits
Problem Statement: Accept a number from the user and count the OFF bits in that number
Enter a number: 4042683594 (11110000111101100111010011001010)
Number of OFF bits in 4042683594 = 14

==================================================================================
Program10_Display_common_ON_bits_position_in_teo_numbers
Problem Statement: Accept two numbers from the user. Display positions which have ON bits in both the numbers
Enter first number: 4042683594  (11110000111101100111010011001010)
