Project1: Online test series application
Summary - 
The application would present a UI where a user can take up an online test.
He will be presented with a list of modules to select(eg: C, DS, DB, OS, etc) and in each module a level to select (1, 2, 3). The user decides to take up the test and the timer starts.
A set of 25 questions - MCQs will be presented, Options to select and save, go back to the previous questions, move forward to the next questions without attempting, etc will be supported.
Submit option will check, all questions are attempted. On submitting user will be presented his/her score. Option to retake test, take another test or exit application will appear.
An admin module to add questions in each category - this will require authentication (admin credentials).
Technical Details - 
Database - to store the questions in each category statically.
Win32 SDk for the GUI of the application
C language for functionality. 
We will use a doubly circular linked list to store the status of each question while test is being attempted. eg: DCLL will be created with 25 nodes when user starts test. Status of nodes updated as questions are attempted. After submit, score calculation performed based on data stored in the nodes. Ability to view correct questions, wrong questions, correct answer for a question will involve Linked List operations.
